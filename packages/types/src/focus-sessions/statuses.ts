/**
 * The `focus_sessions.status` vocabulary — ONE declaration, platform-wide.
 *
 * Lives in `@synap-core/types` (a leaf module with ZERO imports, safe in
 * browser, Electron, Node and CLI) because the backend is no longer the only
 * consumer: the browser renders a session's lifecycle and would otherwise mint
 * a fourth hand-written copy of these four strings — the hand-mirrored-
 * vocabulary defect this platform keeps paying for.
 *
 * `packages/api/src/services/focus-sessions/session-statuses.ts` re-exports
 * these, so every existing backend importer is unchanged.
 *
 * A lockstep tripwire (`__tripwires__/declared-enum-covers-column.test.ts`)
 * asserts `SESSION_STATUSES` covers the `focus_sessions.status` column enum, so
 * a new DB state can never exist that this list does not know about.
